Team 3D Game Work
=================

For this project (and the coming weeks) you'll break into groups and develop
a 3D game.
Your goal is to improve this game, week-by-week.

Starting the Project
--------------------

* Start with one of your roll-a-ball games as a working base.
* Invite other team members to that project.
* You must cite any 3d models, textures, sounds that you use from another source.

  * Get this started by creating a section in your readme to hold this info.

* Figure out how you want to stay in contact. Exchange info. (E-mail, slack, discord, etc.)
* Brainstorm Ideas

  * Theme?
  * Color scheme? See `Adobe Kuler <https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel>`_ and create a swatch?
  * Create one or more tasks for everyone. Backup tasks are a good idea. See "Some Ideas On Tasks"

Each Week on Thursday
---------------------

* Pick goals/tasks for each person to get done that week.
* Enter each task as an issue in GitHub.
* Assign it to the proper person.
* If you notice bugs, enter them in GitHub and assign to the proper person.

Each Week on Tuesday
--------------------

* Make sure everyone's work has been merged into GitHub.
* Test your application to make sure it is working.
* Help each other with the tasks and bugs.

Some Ideas on Tasks
-------------------

* Object modeling

  * Create an interesting playing field
  * Add more objects, add more detail to objects

* Materials

  * Learn some of the options for materials, and make things shiny, etc.
  * Note: Learn these in Unity, not Blender. Blender to Unity material transfer is limited.

* Textures

  * Map an image onto an item (UV Mapping) Can do in Blender or Unity.
  * Learn to use normal maps
  * Create water

* Shaders

  * Work with shaders to create better looking materials

* Lighting

  * Instead of one generic light, add better lighting. Spot lights, lamps, etc.

* Skybox

  * Learn to add a skybox

* Sound

  * Add sound for pickups
  * Add sound when bouncing into objects
  * Add sound for movement

* Create level system

  * Go to new level if all items are picked up
  * Go to new level if player gets to a goal point

* Enemies

  * Create items that reset the user to the start if you bump into them
  * Create have player lose a life when hitting enemy
  * Support 'game over' when player loses all lives
  * Have enemy move towards player
  * Investigate path finding to have enemy move around objects

* Particles

  * Create liquids, smoke, clouds, flames, magic effects

* Shooting

  * Be able to shoot things. Enemies, collectables, walls.

* UI

  * Create intro/instruction screens
  * Allow game restart
  * Show lives left
  * Add background/panel to UI
  * Add dialog system (encounter NPC, have popup dialog)

* Multiplayer

  * Add networking

* Animation

  * Animate obstacles
  * Make moving platforms
  * Create switches that trigger events
  * Create a 3d car instead of a ball to move around
  * Create a 3d walking character rather than a rolling ball

* Player

  * Add ability to jump
  * Add ability to run

Important Notes
---------------

* Do not add assets into a folder without using Unity.
  This will lead to merge errors that will lose you a lot of time.
* If working on a challenging item, have a back-up goal.
  You've got to get something done, so you don't want to be stuck if things
  are more complex than expected.
* Everyone must be on the same version of Unity. Do not upgrade your Unity.
  That will force everyone to upgrade, or you'll just end up losing your work.


Turn In
-------

Turn in a report.

* Summarize what you finished this week.
* Link to the GitHub project.
* Link to the issue that has the item(s) you worked on.
* Link to your commits. It will look something like:
