   * - Create animated time-based sprite frames 1
     - 10
     - Create at least 8 frames of a time-based sprite.
       This can be from the fire or water sprite created in class
       during :ref:`2d_animation`. To turn in, take a screenshot and show
       the resulting images.
   * - Create animated time-based sprite in Unity 1
     - 5
     - Get the animated sprite from above working in Unity. Slow down the keyframes so it doesn't run
       full speed.
   * - Create animated time-based sprite frames 2
     - 10
     - Create at least 8 frames of a time-based sprite.
   * - Create animated time-based sprite in Unity 2
     - 5
     - Get the sprite working.
   * - Create animated time-based character sprite frames
     - 10
     - Create "idle" and "walking" animations in Aseprite. Show the images created.
   * - Create animated time-based character sprite in Unity
     - 10
     - Idle animation must play. When character moves, the walking animation must start. When character
       is done walking, go back to idle. Select left/right based on direction character is moving.
   * - Create animated time-based NPC sprite frames
     - 10
     - Create one more moving animation, this time for an NPC. Must have two different animations. (Idle/walk)
   * - Create animated time-based NPC sprite in Unity
     - 10
     - Get both animations and transition to work for NPC character.
   * - Expand level
     - 10
     - Take the level that you have, and make it bigger. I suggest showing the original level, and the
       expansion. You'll probably want at least two screens worth of additional layout.
