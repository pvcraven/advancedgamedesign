Custom Roll-a-Ball
==================

* Start with your prior roll-a-ball assignment.
* Create at least two objects in Blender, and add them as obstacles in your game.

  * Obstacles must be at least as complex as the trees we created.
  * Obstacles must not be the same trees we created. Do something different.
  * Obstacles must have at least two different materials on them.

* Update the collectable to have a custom shape you create in blender.

  * Feel free to turn off the rotation if it doesn't work for your collectable.

* Update your playing field with a custom playing field created in Blender.
* Grading will be a somewhat subjective. Impress me, don't shoot for the minimum.
