2D Assignment 2
===============

In this assignment, we'll get continue work on our 2D level.

Requirements
------------

Turn in a report detailing and showing (with screenshots) your completion of:


.. list-table:: Point Allocation
   :widths: 25 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Item
     - Points
     - Scoring
   * - Basic Tiles Created
     - 15
     - Set of 12 background tiles, as shown in class. Must have some detail to
       get full 15 points.
   * - Additional tiles created
     - 15
     - Create at least three additional tiles. I'd suggest something that would
       be an obstruction, or additional background tiles.
   * - Background tile map layer
     - 20
     - Background tile layer. Must be reasonably extensive for the full 20
       points.
   * - Collision tile map layer
     - 15
     - Add things to run into as part of tile tile map.
   * - Sound effects added
     - 20
     - Sound effect for points up, points down, and level up/down.
   * - Unity background music
     - 15
     - Play some background music. Don't forget to turn it off when changing
       levels.

Scoring:

* 0 pts - not implemented
* 1-5 pts - buggy
* 6-7 pts - meets minimum requirements. i.e., it works.
* 8-9 pts - Expanded beyond minimum requirements
* 10 pts - Expanded into something that looks like an actual game.

Directions
----------

To get started, clone our project. Get invited as a collaborator.

**All item names must include yours so we can identify them.**

Then most of what you need to get started is at: :ref:`unity2d_part_1`.

The main thing not covered is getting some objects to move via
scripts. I'm leaving that up to you to figure out.
