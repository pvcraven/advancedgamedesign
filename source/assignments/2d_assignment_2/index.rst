2D Assignment 2
===============

In this assignment, we'll get continue work on our 2D level. This assignment
will concentrate on:

* 2D Tile maps
* Adding sound effects

Requirements
------------

Turn in a report detailing and showing (with screenshots) your completion of:


.. list-table:: Point Allocation
   :widths: 30 20 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Item
     - Points
     - Scoring
   * - Basic Tiles Created
     - 15
     - Set of 12 background tiles, as shown in class. Must have some detail to
       get full 15 points.
   * - Additional tiles created
     - 15
     - Create at least three additional tiles. I'd suggest something that would
       be an obstruction, or additional background tiles.
   * - Background tile map layer
     - 20
     - Background tile layer. Must be reasonably extensive for the full 20
       points.
   * - Collision tile map layer
     - 15
     - Add things to run into as part of tile tile map.
   * - Sound effects added
     - 20
     - Sound effect for points up, points down, and level up/down.
   * - Unity background music
     - 15
     - Play some background music. Don't forget to turn it off when changing
       levels.

Directions
----------

Most of what you need to get started with the tiles
can be found in :ref:`unity2d_part_2`.

The sound effects and background music should not be too hard. I'm leaving it
up to your web-search skills to figure out how to add that.
