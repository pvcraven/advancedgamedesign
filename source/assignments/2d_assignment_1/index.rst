2D Assignment 1
===============

In this assignment, we'll get started with 2D.

Requirements
------------

Turn in a report detailing and showing (with screenshots) your completion of:


.. list-table:: Point Allocation
   :widths: 75 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Item
     - Points
   * - Sprite 1
     - 10
   * - Sprite 2
     - 10
   * - Sprite 3
     - 10
   * - Sprite 4
     - 10
   * - Sprite 5
     - 10
   * - Scene
     - 10
   * - Proper collision
     - 10
   * - Implement scored items
     - 10
   * - Implement next level transition
     - 10

Scoring:

* 0 pts - not implemented
* 1-5 pts - buggy
* 6-7 pts - meets minimum requirements. i.e., it works.
* 8-9 pts - Expanded beyond minimum requirements
* 10 pts - Expanded into something that looks like an actual game.

Directions

**All item names must include yours so we can identify them.**

Then most of what you need to get started is at: :ref:`unity2d_part_1`.

The main thing not covered is getting some objects to move via
scripts. I'm leaving that up to you to figure out.
