Texture Objects
===============

We want to put an image on an object, rather than just have a solid color.

Texture Types
-------------

There are several types of textures.

* Diffuse/Albido map - Color for object. The is the basics of what you need.
  Although the image can look "flat." Think bricks. Shouldn't look flat, but will
  be with just a diffuse map.
* Bump maps - Create illusion of depth via grayscale data. Shade of gray is height.
* Normal maps - Better than bump maps, uses RGB for more info. This can give us
  x, y, and z. Allows for angle and more realistic looks.
* Displacement map - Actually changes surface they are on.
* Specular - Maps out what part of the image is shiny.
